#Getting Started with PHP#

As with learning any programming language, I highly reccommend that you tackle
the [tutorial](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php) on the official PHP website. This is a good way to learn the basics. In addition to this reading there will be a small assignment below to test your skills and understanding with PHP.

##PHP Assignment##

This assignment will test your understanding of how PHP can be used to pass data from one webpage to another. You will produce two files *form.hml* and *receive.php*. *form.html* will simply contain a form with one submit button and one text field in which you will type a name. Clicking the submit button will take us to *receive.php*. This page should say 'Hello X' where X is the name that you typed on the previous page of *form.html*. You are to submit this small application to our server in the following folders:

- /var/www/html/youngchan/
- /var/www/html/linda/
- /var/www/html/lakmi/
- /var/www/html/regis/
- /var/www/html/nuwan/

It is important to know how HTML forms work in general for this assignment. Remember, you can transmit data from one page to another via the HTTP POST or GET methods. Use GET for this example. I will explain how the server works and how to connect to it.
